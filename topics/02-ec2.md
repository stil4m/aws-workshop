# EC2

## Theory

- Compute in the cloud.
- As 'Bare metal' as it will get on AWS.
- 'Traditional'. You could become a hosting provider on EC2.
- AMI.

## Demo

- Launch a EC2 instance (micro.t2)
- Security group with port 8080 and SSH.
- Install java, download JAR (from S3).
- Run the app. Show that it works via public IP.
- Setup Userdata. Launch an instance with that.

## Hands-on

- Run your own app on EC2 (use Userdata).
- Install Apache (port forward).

## Additional Theory

- Load balancer;
- Auto scaling group;
- VPC/Subnets.
